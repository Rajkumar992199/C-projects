* <u> Array: </u> <br>
 - <u> Column Major: </u> A column-major array stores elements in consecutive memory locations by columns, optimizing access for column-based operations. <br>
 - <u> Count Character: </u> Counting characters in an array involves iterating through the array, tallying occurrences of each character, and storing counts. <br>
 - <u> Delete Element: </u> Deleting an element from an array involves finding the element, shifting subsequent elements left, and reducing the array's size. <br>
 - <u> Display By Pointer: </u> Displaying an array by pointer involves iterating through the array using a pointer, printing each element sequentially. <br>
 - <u> Insert Element: </u> Inserting elements into an array involves shifting subsequent elements right, placing the new element at the desired position. <br>
 - <u> Row Major: </u> A row-major array stores elements in consecutive memory locations by rows, optimizing access for row-based operations. <br>
 - <u> Search Element: </u> Searching for an element in an array involves iterating through the array and comparing each element to the target value. <br>
 - <u> Sort Element: </u> Sorting elements in an array involves rearranging the elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending, using a sorting algorithm. <br>
 * <u> Stack: </u> <br>
 - <u> Pop: </u> Popping in a stack involves removing the top element, adjusting the top pointer, and returning the removed element. <br>
 - <u> Push: </u> Pushing in a stack involves adding an element to the top, adjusting the top pointer, and increasing the stack size. <br>
